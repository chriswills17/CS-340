How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? 
Ensuring that code is as simple as possible going in, alongside maintaining proper commentary for the code helps in its readability. The functions and Python portion, with small and simple edits made, could be easily used for other databases that were being worked on during the course.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? 
This being my first foray in database management and coding, I was able to approach this novelly without any preexisting biases concerning how the approach should be. Keeping things as simple as possible while still meeting requirements assisted greatly in debugging and refactoring.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? 
In this instance, a computer scientists facilitated the manipulation and viewing of data, enabling an end user to better understand said data available. Data is an invaluable asset as technology grows, so having someone in place that is able to translate and transform the data into something more easily understood will help the company in question utilize the data to make business decisions to better their organization along with the possibility of creating better products and services for their clients.
